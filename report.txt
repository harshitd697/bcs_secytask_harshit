Custom News Classifier Report
==============================
Dataset: Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)
Tokenizer:
- Expands contractions (e.g., isn't → is not)
- Normalizes repeats (e.g., sooooo → so <REPEAT:5>)
- Preserves emoticons (e.g., :D)
POS Tagger:
- Uses suffix rules for nouns (-tion), verbs (-ing), adjectives (-ous)
Lemmatizer:
- Applies POS-based rules (e.g., running → run for verbs)
Performance:

Naive Bayes:
  Accuracy: 0.9395
  Precision: 0.9517
  Recall: 0.9188
  F1: 0.9349

SVM:
  Accuracy: 0.9531
  Precision: 0.9461
  Recall: 0.9553
  F1: 0.9507

Comparison with Off-the-Shelf:
- Custom tokenizer handles repeats better
- Rule-based POS/lemmatization is simple but less robust than spaCy
